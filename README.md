SO what do you want to make app wise?
Couple ideas this is hard to typ eon tbh. One is a glorfied tracking app for food for college kids and or work places. Another might what makays capstone was but he never finished coz I liked it a lot. OR OR OR RO RO RO, a tentacle based app : D, 

Which one interests you most??
What was Mackay’s capstone?
So u enter in like a food and gets alist of receipies that use that food object which you used. However his only had one such as chiken but would pop up all chiken stuff. But lets say u hav chiken, pork, and sugar u want to use. U cannot (for his) search it based on that. I wnted to extend that and allow you to change the recepi once downloded as well as make your own and upload that to a firestore, with a rating system

So I guess my part of it, is I could provide a database (probably not firestore) and a backend API to interact with that database. I could see a good use for that kind of application for the first two projects (mackays and the first recipe one), but I don’t know how it would apply to a tenticle app lol

So which app would you prefer a backend for??

idk either I just like tentacles. Also would be fun to use them in neato animations.  Makays is the recipi one, he just didnt finish it and ended up cutting a lot fo content from it. I wanted tp revive and fix it. Make it coolio. So id say his, since the only idea I have for tentacles is just that: P

So if we go forward with Mackay’s app, I would say we can create a user system, and store their data. We could store saved recipes, maybe track searches, and just generally make it easier to access your REST API (if you know what that is, it’s just the API your getting the recipes from). Could also suppliment the Food API with more functionality on our end. So like if they don’t have food tags we could add that feature.

The tag feture wold be E Z. u can us emany api’s, I used food2fork, but might try and searcha round for a better one thathas more pratical recipi. Would save the recipis to their local storage, and allow them to upload it as well

Okay so you would want recipe upload functionality where their recipes can basically be added to the one’s available from the API. Maybe we can have a social networking system(friends, sharing with friends, etc), or we could use Oauth to use an already established social network (i.e. facebook, twitter, etc). Any other features you would like from a backend API, and Database perspective??

I think that works for a solid base idea of an mvp.
